# /salmo Command Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a `/salmo` command following the modular command implementation pattern used throughout the fairfruitbot-telegram repository.

## Components Created

### 1. SalmoFetcher (`src/fetchers/salmo_fetcher.py`)
- Inherits from the base `Fetcher` class
- Scrapes psalm content from https://www.bibliaon.com/salmo_do_dia/
- Includes fallback mechanism:
  - Primary: crawl4ai (when available)
  - Fallback: requests + BeautifulSoup 
- Handles multiple CSS selectors to find psalm content
- Robust error handling with Portuguese error messages
- Returns structured data: title, content, url

### 2. Salmo Command (`src/commands/salmo.py`)
- Inherits from the base `Command` class
- Implements the `/salmo` command
- Formats messages with date, title, content, and link
- Includes content truncation for Telegram message limits
- Sends typing indicator while processing
- Follows authorization patterns used by other commands

### 3. Integration
- Added `SalmoFetcher` to `src/fetchers/__init__.py`
- Added `Salmo` command to `src/commands/__init__.py`
- Registered command in `src/bot.py`
- Added crawl4ai dependency to `requirements.txt`

### 4. Testing
- Created comprehensive standalone tests in `src/tests/test_salmo_standalone.py`
- Tests cover initialization, error handling, successful responses, and message formatting
- All tests pass successfully
- Existing tests continue to pass

## Key Features
- ✅ Follows existing modular architecture pattern
- ✅ Robust web scraping with multiple fallback strategies
- ✅ Portuguese language support for all user-facing text
- ✅ Proper Telegram message formatting with HTML
- ✅ Content length handling for Telegram limits
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Authorization support (respects user/group restrictions)
- ✅ Typing indicators for better UX
- ✅ Fully tested with both unit and integration tests

## Usage
Users can now use `/salmo` to get the daily psalm from bibliaon.com, formatted appropriately for Telegram with a link to view the complete psalm.

The implementation is production-ready and maintains consistency with the existing codebase patterns and standards.
