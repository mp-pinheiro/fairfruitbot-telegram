# TypoDetector Debug Analysis

## Problem Description
The "naris" scenario from production logs shows the word appearing 3 times by different users but TypoDetector is not triggering:

```
2025-07-16 14:29:25,721 - root - INFO - GroupSummary - chat: -redacted - user: (1) u1 - text: bagulho já foi de naris pro fim do planeta
2025-07-16 14:29:40,849 - root - INFO - GroupSummary - chat: -redacted - user: (2) u2 - text: naris
2025-07-16 14:29:53,655 - root - INFO - GroupSummary - chat: -redacted - user: (3) u3 - text: naris
```

**Expected**: TypoDetector should trigger on the third message
**Actual**: No TypoDetector trigger occurred

## Analysis Results

### ✅ TypoDetector Logic is Correct
- The pattern detection logic works correctly for the "naris" scenario
- "naris" is correctly identified as a potential typo (not in Portuguese word list)
- 3 different users requirement: ✅ (u1, u2, u3)
- Has part of longer message: ✅ (u1's message has 9 words)
- Has full message: ✅ (u2 and u3's messages have 1 word each)
- All tests pass including specific test for this scenario

### ✅ Code Changes from PR #20
PR #20 made significant improvements to TypoDetector:
- Added Portuguese words filtering (1.1M words)
- Changed trigger requirement from 2 users to 3 users
- Added context requirements (both long and short message occurrences)
- The "naris" scenario meets all these new requirements

### ❌ Production Issue
The fact that we see GroupSummary logs but NO TypoDetector logs suggests:
1. **Configuration mismatch**: Production SUMMARY_GROUP_IDS might not include the chat where "naris" occurred
2. **Code deployment issue**: Production might be running older TypoDetector code
3. **Setup failure**: TypoDetector might have failed to initialize in production

## Debugging Enhancements Added

### Enhanced Logging
- **Startup logging**: Shows TypoDetector configuration on initialization
- **Message processing logging**: Logs all messages processed (like GroupSummary)
- **Debug logging**: Shows when messages are ignored due to group ID mismatch
- **Error logging**: Enhanced error reporting

### Expected Log Output
With the enhanced logging, you should see:

```
# On bot startup:
INFO - TypoDetector initialized - target groups: [list], min users: 3, Portuguese words: 1162241

# For each message in target groups:
INFO - TypoDetector - chat: <chat_id> - user: (<user_id>) <username> - text: <message>

# When triggering:
INFO - TypoDetector triggered for typo: '<text>' - original by user <original_user>

# When ignoring messages (debug level):
DEBUG - TypoDetector - ignoring message from chat <chat_id> (not in target groups: [list])
```

### New Test
Added `test_naris_scenario_reproduction` that validates the exact scenario and confirms it should trigger.

## Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Production Logs
Look for these log messages on bot startup:
- `TypoDetector initialized - target groups: [...]` 
- Compare the target groups with the actual chat ID from GroupSummary logs

### 2. Check Message Processing
Look for TypoDetector message logs:
- If you see `TypoDetector - chat: <id>` logs, TypoDetector is processing messages
- If you don't see these logs, there's a configuration or setup issue

### 3. Check for Debug Messages
Enable debug logging and look for:
- `TypoDetector - ignoring message from chat <id>` indicates group ID mismatch

### 4. Verify Code Version
Ensure production is running the latest code with PR #20 changes:
- Check for Portuguese words file existence
- Verify 3-user trigger logic is in place
- Check enhanced logging is present

## Most Likely Root Causes

1. **Group ID Configuration Mismatch** (Most Likely)
   - Production SUMMARY_GROUP_IDS doesn't include the chat where "naris" occurred
   - GroupSummary and TypoDetector should use the same group IDs from Environment

2. **Code Version Mismatch**
   - Production is running old TypoDetector code before PR #20
   - Missing Portuguese words file or 3-user logic

3. **Silent Initialization Failure**
   - TypoDetector failed to initialize but bot continued running
   - Missing dependencies or environment variables

## Recommended Actions

1. **Deploy Enhanced Logging**: Deploy this version with enhanced logging
2. **Monitor Startup Logs**: Check TypoDetector initialization logs
3. **Monitor Message Logs**: Verify TypoDetector processes messages from the target group
4. **Compare Configurations**: Ensure GroupSummary and TypoDetector target same groups
5. **Test in Staging**: Reproduce the scenario in a test environment

## Test Commands

To verify the fix works locally:

```bash
# Run specific test for naris scenario
python -m pytest src/tests/test_typo_detector.py::TestTypoDetector::test_naris_scenario_reproduction -v

# Run all TypoDetector tests
python -m pytest src/tests/test_typo_detector.py -v
```

The enhanced logging will help identify the exact reason why TypoDetector isn't triggering in production.
